            <p>
              I recently graduated from the Carnegie Mellon University Master of
              Entertainment Technology program and joined Duolingo as a product
              designer.I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic Product Designer
              with a strong passion for 3D and AR/VR design. I enjoy combining
              my artistic background with my technical skills to create
              innovative and creative solutions. I have experience developing
              visionary concepts, conducting user research, and establishing
              product frameworks through the use of animated and interactive
              prototypes. Possessing a positive attitude and a growth-oriented
              mindset, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my
              knowledge and skills as a designer.
